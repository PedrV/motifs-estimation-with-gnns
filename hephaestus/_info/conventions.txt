The format used to represent graphs is: u v x. Where u,v >= 1 and x represents the edge weight.
Graphs are distributed among datasets. Each dataset has a name e.g. ENZYMES. Each graph in the dataset
also has a name. Hence, to refer to a graph named 0 of the ENZYMES dataset to ENZYMES@0.
The graph file should be under ENZYMES@0.csv.

If the graph name is to have additional information appended to its name it should be separated by "+".
For example, ENZYMES@0+graph+0+modification+32.csv,
dBINOMIAL_TREE@networkx.binomial_tree+graph+32+param+2+cycle+1.csv,
LARGEDATASET@alien_graph+graph+42+param+0.csv ...
This is useful if many graphs have the same name and differ
only on the parameters used to create them e.g. dBINOMIAL_TREE@networkx.binomial_tree+graph+32+param+2+cycle+1.csv.
The symbols between the "@" and the last "." are the graph name. In the examples above, the graph names would be:
"0", "networkx.binomial_tree+graph+32+param+2+cycle+1", "alien_graph+graph+42+param+0".

The score obtained by GTRIE is always of the form DATASETNAME@GRAPHNAME.score-sizeSIZE.
(Caps where to denote a "variable", the names do not have to be in uppercase)
For example ENZYMES@0.score-size3 for the results for graph 0 of ENZYMES using subgraphs of size 3.
If multiple subgraph sizes are used e.g. 3,4 and 5, then each graph will have a file for each size e.g.
ENZYMES@0.score-size3, ENZYMES@0.score-size4, ENZYMES@0.score-size5.
The final file consisting of all files for all sizes is named ENZYMES@0.score.

The labels for the dataset are under the name DATASETNAME_labels.csv e.g. ENZYMES_labels.csv, KarateClub_labels.csv.
Each line represents the normalized scores (under a chosen normalization scheme) for a graph in the dataset.

The attributes/features for the nodes of a graph of a dataset are in a file named DATASETNAME@GRAPHNAME_features.csv.
Each line represents the features for a node of a graph of a dataset. This means that each graph will have its
feature file.

Symbols:
"@": Separates the dataset name from the rest.
"+": Separates the additional information that a graph has in its name. Each field is in the format "fieldname+val",
    chaining multiple fields yields e.g. "graph+42+param+0".
"-": Reserved for intermediate scores of GTRIE.
"bbb_aaa.ccc": If it exists additional file identifiers e.g. denoting the file is a label file, that indication should be
    after the last "_" and before the extension of the file.
    For example dBINOMIAL_TREE@networkx.binomial_tree+graph+32+param+2+cycle+1_features.csv has multiple "_" in its
    name, but if we want to check for its identifier it should be between the last underscore and
    the extension of the file. If the output of that split makes sense then the file as a file identifier.
"xxx@yyy+zzz.uuu": xxx is the dataset name, yyy the canonical graph name, zzz the additional information in the graph
    name and uuu the file extension. "yyy+zzz" correspond to the full graph name.
